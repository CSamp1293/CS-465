# CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN

## Architecture
This project utilized two different styles of front-end development:
* (Express HTML & JavaScript: The original server-rendered pages used Handlebars (HBS) as a templating engine within the Express.js app. This allowed for dynamic HTML generation on the server based on data from MongoDB. It's useful for simple, multi-page websites with traditional navigation.)
* (Angular Single Page Application (SPA): For the admin site, a modern Angular SPA was implemented. Angular offers dynamic routing, reusable components, two-way data binding, and seamless client-side state management. This architecture is faster and more responsive from a user experience perspective.
